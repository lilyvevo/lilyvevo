    Reflections

    Over this year I’ve learned a lot through reading and writing, and expanded my horizons. With every new skill I gather, my knack for literature gets bigger and goes deeper. Just like the ocean! When I began, I was wading in tidal pools- reading what I
    was used to, writing what I liked to write. But as the year went on I expanded into more areas- read books I would never have normally read, going outside the genres I liked, and writing more about the world around me. Now I’m swimming in the deep
    end, and I’m happy with how far I’ve come.

    For my creative essay, this was an incredibly personal piece. Not to be sappy or anything, but it was very freeing to write. I’ve always wanted to talk about my experience with type one diabetes, but I could never really find the right words. Every time
    I wrote something it felt messy and vitriolic- it turns out I didn’t need to write very much. In just about 500 words, I wrote out all of my feelings, and I hope that they might inspire someone, maybe to do the same, or to appreciate themselves a
    little more. That’s what it was all about- life can be really hard- for everyone- and I think people should give themselves credit for the difficult things they do everyday.

    When it comes to argumentative essays… I think I discovered my passion! As much as I love fantasy and personal writing, argumentative essays are something so new and so fresh for me. I wrote my first one, one about gun control, and I fell in love with
    them. I’ve never written something like it before. It might be because I like to complain and rant a lot- writing these essays is just an outlet for that. Either way, I’m happy I got the opportunity to write things like this, and also that I learned
    how to back up my points, instead of just.. Rambling.

    As for reading, I’m quite satisfied with what I did this year. I have a bad habit of just reading the same genre or the same books over and over again. I lose interest really quickly. But, this year I forced myself to get exposed and try something new-
    making myself read <i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</i> even though I thought the next mention of ruby slippers would drive me crazy, after I worked on the school’s production of the musical. And you know what? I liked it! I also found out I do like
    realistic fiction- a genre I previously pledged to hate for being cheesy and boring.
