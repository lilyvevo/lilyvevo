  An Uncomftorably Deep Analysis of the Wonderful Wizard of Oz
  </h1>
  <p class="info">
  <i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</i>, by Frank L. Baum, has been a long-treasured story, and held close to heart by a lot of people- it’s a play, a book and a movie, with catchy songs and colorful illustrations. Including me; I took part in a theater production of it, working on tech crew.<sup>1</sup> Even though my time with it was relatively short, I got into it pretty quickly, and as I looked deeper I realized this fabulous fairytale of witches and yellow brick roads had a deeper message hidden in its pages. I’m addressing the book in this essay, not the movie and the many different versions of the show.  In all editions, Dorothy is swept off away from her home on the Kansas prairie to the magical land of Oz, where she meets odd characters on her quest to go home. The book version is significantly darker; if you remember in the play, the witch sends her cartoonish minions after the main quartet. In this version, she sends a legion of wolves, which the Tin Man beheads one by one. This might not be the Oz you remember, but key parts are the same. After reading over this book a good few times, its political commentary is more clear. The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is a book promoting populism.
  </p>
  <p class="info">
   	For a little background, populism is the political ideology that the established, elite class doesn’t care at all for the needs or wants of the less wealthy and poor. During the time frame The Wonderful Wizard of Oz was written, in the 1890s, there was a significant social gap between the poor and rich, which led to the rise of populism. Many hints towards it are embedded throughout the book.
  </p>
  <p class="info">The first subtle example is the description and detailing of the setting. The book is infamous for its outlandish environment- including the Yellow Brick Road to the Emerald City. Dorothy, dressed in silver slippers (instead of ruby ones, like in the movie) travels down this road to meet the amazing Oz, a man of wealth and power, located in the shining City, whose citizens live in luxury. The constant repetition of the splendor of the City, as compared to Kansas’s gray, bleak fields, are a nod to a gap between social classes. Oz, who is the established elite in this case, lives in a utopia that serves his every whim, while Dorothy and the others live in much less bedazzling places that are nonetheless still their homes. The silver and yellow also play a small role in this; yellow could also mean gold, which is the most valuable of all metals. Silver is thought to be second-class or less- you get a silver medal for second place, and a gold for first. This implies that Dorothy and the others are <i>lesser</i> than Oz with his city of riches. This serves to set the stage for other metaphors and analogies throughout the story.
  </p>
  <p class="info">
   Another example comes in the characterization of the Scarecrow and Tinman, two pivotal characters. The Scarecrow, who lives without a brain and longs for the great Oz to give him one, works in a cornfield. He’s not too bright, but he’s often shown to be resourceful and clever, getting the group out of tough situations. The Tinman, who is unsurprisingly a man made of tin, longs for a heart so that he might love again, but he’s shown to be the most emotional of the group- almost crying when he stepped on a bug and killed it. These two characters, who have already been implied to be representations of the working class, are more obviously incarnations when you consider the time the book came out. In the 1890s, America was changing fast after the Civil War and industrial revolution. Less people lived out on rural farms, leaving people who did own them in the dust, and the focus of industry shifted to factories, and in those factories, more and more machines were being used. As automation increased, many humans lost their jobs to machines who could do it all faster- just like the Tinman, whose once living body was replaced by metal after being fought by the Wicked Witch. He no longer has a heart- just like machines- now pumping out products for mass consumption, who don’t put in the same kind of love a human can. The Scarecrow is constantly underestimated, like farmers back in the day, who only needed some education to succeed.
  </p>
  <p class="info">The final example could be a little darker than the others. In the 1890s, the rise of political machines came. They were organizations who would pool support for a candidate, much like a PAC, but they would bribe constituents into voting instead of activism or just convincing them to do so. People at the top rings of political machines grew strong, able to manipulate and sway elections to their liking, having amassed tons of money and power. Just like the Wonderful Wizard. As soon as Dorothy hears of him, she’s bewildered- he’s a formidable magician, who lives in a city full of treasure. But, at the end of the book it’s all revealed to really be a complete lie. All of Oz’s illusions are puppetry, like card tricks. Even though everything Oz has made is a lie, everyone still believes him- he looks like he’s a wizard, and no one’s seen what he really is inside to know for sure. With his fake magic tricks, Oz keeps everyone under his thumb- including all the Witches, who are real and actually have magic- and he garners respect and sometimes fear from all his constituents. Oz is a metaphor for the leader of a political machine, who preys on the less fortunate and aware to accumulate influence.<sup>2</sup>
  <p class="info"> It all sounds awfully sinister as I write this out, but when you consider the events of the 1890s, it all matches up. It wasn’t a very exciting part of U.S history- it’s probably the part you’ll fall asleep during in class, but it’s important. <i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</i> characterizes this era- how socioeconomic groups had vast gasps between them, how the working class was left behind, and how easily people could be manipulated for monetary gain. They’re all still issues relevant today- regardless of your take on current events, bribery and cheating are still alive and well. Even in a dated book from the twentieth century, <i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</i> makes the case for populism- and somehow still kept a kid-friendly rating. I mean, really- the Scarecrow snaps the necks of forty crows. If this is children’s literature then literally anything is.

      <B>1: </B>Often, literary analysis doesn't have very much relation to the reader, or at least it seems that way. Here, I link back to simpler times of school plays, which might make the person reading this feel like my analysis is a little more relevant to them.</p>

      <b>2: </b>This part was super fun to write. I used evidence in the story to support my point really well, even if my point might have been a little bit of a stretch.
