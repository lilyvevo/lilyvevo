    From Lockdown Drills to Congress Bills
  </h1>
  <p class="info">
    I am a student, so naturally writing projects for classes come my way, and I do them. But for this one, I wanted it to really mean something; wanted it to resonate. I know every speech at every rally begins the same way- we’re fighting for [something]-
    and this essay is going to be the same.<sup>1</sup> I know this sounds sappy, but this isn’t just about guns- it’s about life, something precious instilled in every human being. It’s about you, me, and us. Gun violence is an everybody issue.
  </p>
  <p class="info">
    First off, obviously not everyone is a good American gun owner; if they were, stuff like what we’re dealing with wouldn’t happen. If you hunt for sport and don’t poach, that is okay- you aren’t the problem. In order to be proactive about violence, we
    need to keep people who are potentially dangerous from having access to the powerful tool that is a gun. There’s suggested ways to go about this, but the most viable option is an extensive background check, in addition to waiting periods.
  </p>
  <p class="info">I don’t understand why people seem afraid of checks. If you are a stable person and have nothing to hide, you should not be afraid. Privacy is important, but no one should die because we didn’t double check to see if the person we’re selling a gun to
    is a threat; it’s like how you hold scissors pointed down while you walk so you won’t hurt anybody. ‘Threat’ is a word used to refer to people who are mentally ill to the degree of violence. One thing I feel really strongly about is the stigmatizing
    of people with mental disorders that’s breezed off of the gun debate. Not all mentally ill people are a threat- people with depression and anxiety and many other disorders are of no danger to the public- but there are signs that point to people who
    are a concern, which is why we ought to have background checks.
  </p>
  <p class="info">
    It has been said that checks are already extensive- but yet we still have these tragedies. People obtain guns through unlicensed sellers who aren’t required to do background checks- and this is entirely legal on the federal level, excluding thirteen states
    with additional laws. We need to shut loopholes. Waiting periods are also important; one day someone could be vicious enough to shoot someone, and they go to buy a gun- but if there was a three or four day period of wait, they would have time to calm
    down, and there’d also be time to do a full audit of their actions. There are state-issued waiting periods in five of fifty states. We don’t have to take away everyone’s rifles and collector’s items, but we can take precautionary measures to avoid
    issues in the future. We put criminals in jail. Why don’t we crack down on them getting guns?
  </p>
  <p class="info"> Second, why do you need an AR15 or a gun used in military combat?
  </p>
  <p class="info">Just think about that for a moment. Why would anybody need a weapon that can kill 17 people, in 7 minutes? A frequent answer to that is I need to defend myself from a tyrannical government. If the government were to ever become that way, which it most
    likely won’t anytime soon- in fact, the current administration is peeling off regulations for lots of things- you wouldn’t stand a chance against an army; the odds are stacked high against you. In my eyes, people go for these weapons because they
    are afraid. It’s hard not to be afraid watching the news and seeing pain. It’s hard not to be afraid when everything is changing. But, it’s okay to be afraid; people are afraid with you.<sup>2</sup> Having guns may make some people feel safe, but
    you don’t need them to be safe- really, having more of them puts us more at risk of them getting into the wrong hands- disturbed children get them from their parents and do the kinds of school shootings that become national tragedies. You do not need
    an arsenal, or just one military-grade weapon to defend yourself, and we certainly do not need them in schools. Arming teachers will make school shootings into school shootouts, and it makes more questions than answers. “If a teacher dies, and a student,
    who’s a good student, is able to get the gun, are they now held responsible?”- a question posed by Emma Gonzales, one of the prominent figures of the March for Our Lives. There’s no answer to the gun control dilemma that involves more guns.
  </p>
  <p class="info">With the arming-teachers issue, I feel like the gun debate has gotten even closer to home than ever for me- which was part of my motivation to write this essay. There’s a power dynamic between children and adults that isn’t necessarily a bad one, but
    it’s contributed to how our gun debate plays out. Adults are the experienced ones who understand everything, and teens listen to adults to find their footing in the world. Classically, there is a disconnect between the minds of parents and their children-
    a difference in mindset and a lack of clear communication. But there is where things have been spiced up.
  </p>
  <p class="info"> After the Parkland shooting on February 14th, the students there made a movement that grew before my eyes. I had always regarded my teen age as a restrictive factor- I didn’t know anything, so I didn’t have a place in politics. But these kids- just
    a few years older than I am now, made something big. They’re a force to be reckoned with; they’re speaking in front of crowds just like experienced politicians do.
  </p>
  <p class="info">
    Because us kids are the next ones up who are going to receive the society our parents pass down to us. We have a place here, among presidents and senators and the media. These kids who are just high schoolers going onto college like anybody else are also
    the figureheads of change, and they have lit a fire in me to participate and get engaged. Even if you disagree with everything they stand for, you’ve got to admit- they’ve shaken things up! It’s impressive.
  </p>
  <p class="info">
    Back onto arming teachers. This is an idea that blatantly makes gun violence worse. Students can now obtain guns from schools, and are also now afraid of their teachers knowing that they have a deadly weapon. It’s impossible to imagine my sweet little
    kindergarten teacher with a handgun. If we use those weapons to ‘fight back,’ people will be caught in the crossfire- and as I said before, what if the teachers die? What then?
  </p>
  <p class="info">
    In four years, I will vote, and if you have been reading my essay you’ll know where I’ll stand. I want some form of gun control- not nabbing away your Second Amendment in the name of safety, but keeping guns away from criminals and the mentally ill.
  </p>
  <p class="info">
    Gun violence is an everybody issue- the poor, the rich, all levels of education and social standings, every race, gender and sexuality. We need common sense laws- background checks, waiting periods and a ban on military-style weapons on the federal level.
    Together, we can make a change- Republicans and Democrats have got to come together, and so do adults and kids. There is a solution, and it is common sense gun laws.

      <b>2: </b>This is where my voice becomes strongest. This is a personal issue to me, and a lot of other people, and I channel my feelings here to try to persuade the other side.
