  Another Argumetative Essay, this time on Climate Change
  </h1>
  <p class="info">
    In the past thirty years, the onset of the world’s demise has begun. Well… maybe not demise, but it’s definitely something to be concerned about. Climate change- specifically, global warming. Not enough of us are worried about it- despite many scientific groups confirming its existence, including the American Chemical Society, the American Medical Association, and NASA, there still exists a large enclave of people who insist that global warming isn’t real- and if it is, it isn’t a danger. Climate change is real- and its effects are undoubtedly starting to hurt us.
  </p>
  <p class="info">
   	First, I will address the definition of global warming. Many are quick to point out that the earth goes through natural climate cycles, where it cools and warms, and that is true. When I use the phrase global warming I’m talking about rapid, unusual spikes in heat, over relatively short periods of time. When I say ‘short periods of time’ I mean over the past century. To you this is a very long amount of time, but the Earth is 4.5 billion years old. A hundred years for the Earth is like four years in human-time. Temperature spikes do not normally happen that fast- the ice age was long, and that was when there weren’t any industrial humans around to mess with the temperature.
  </p>
  <p class="info">There is boundless evidence confirming spikes in global temperature. According to NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the temperature has risen about 0.8 degrees Celsius since 1880 (that’s 1.4 degrees in Fahrenheit). You may ask- why does just one degree matter? Temperature changes all the time daily, so what does a single degree over centuries do? Keep in mind, we’re discussing global temperature, which is based on the energy Earth gets from our sun, and how much energy we radiate back into space. This is something that stays very static and doesn’t change a whole lot- we get in a lot of energy, we put a lot of it out. But, the amount of energy Earth puts out is based on the composition of our atmosphere- as our energy goes into space, the atmosphere it goes through can influence how easy it is for that energy to make its way off of Earth. The cause of global warming, as you know, is said to be from greenhouse gases- carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxide, and a few other chemicals that trap heat after they waft into our atmosphere. If these gases trap heat, less of Earth’s energy is radiating out into space like it normally does, and the heat that normally leaves the planet stays here, stuck on Earth. All this extra heat makes our whole globe hotter, therefore raising the global temperature. If you think one degree isn’t a lot, a 5 degree drop in global temperature froze over a swath of North America some 20,000 years ago during the most recent ice age. 
  </p>
  <p class="info">
    Your next thought could be- okay, a rise in global temperatures sounds pretty bad, but what do we humans have to do with it? The answer is… a whole lot! Based on research done by the Environmental Protection Agency in 2016, 28% of all economic-sourced greenhouse gas emissions (in the United States) came from our transportation industry (which burns fossil fuels), an equal portion from electricity production (which burns fossil fuels), 22% from manufacturing (which burns fossil fuels), 11% from commercial and residential areas (which, you guessed, burn fossil fuels)<sup>1</sup> and 9% from agriculture and farming, because animals… emit a lot of methane gas, and farm soil can also produce nitrogen oxide. All of these statistics come from America, as I mentioned, so America has a hand in global warming- it’s not a hoax made by foreign countries. Only a tiny fraction of our atmosphere is greenhouse gas- about 0.1% of it. Most of it is the good stuff, like oxygen, nitrogen and argon. But, as I mentioned in the previous paragraphs, just that 0.1% makes a 1 degree change in global temperature, and though both those numbers seem uselessly tiny and no cause for alarm, they have a gigantic effect on our world.
  </p>
  <p class="info">A common belief is that irreversible global warming will not affect someone personally. Even if you believe in global warming, you think the only people who it’ll directly affect are in tiny, third-world countries you probably don’t know the names of. The popular image of global warming is ice caps melting, leaving polar bears drifting on tiny blocks of ice in a massive, hottening sea, hundreds of miles from our pleasant home of the U.S of A. One part of that is true- ice caps are melting, but the change in global climate does affect us here in the United States. In northern cities, like New York City and Chicago, they’re used to colder climates where it doesn’t stay hot for very long. As global warming takes its toll, these areas will face times of prolonged heat which they aren’t prepared for. In 2012, the National Weather Service forecasted regular summer temperatures in the midwestern and northeastern U.S- instead, those two regions saw heat waves that killed more than a hundred people. Today, in the western United States, there are wildfires raging, and smoke fills the sky as firefighters combat it. If the world temperature keeps going up, these fires will become more powerful, which could create breathing problems from all the debris and smoke, particularly in northern California, Oregon, Idaho and Montana. If the weather gets too hot, our crops won’t grow well enough to produce enough food, which could lead to shortages. While global warming does make stray polar bears and raises the sea level, it threatens the United States directly, along with every other country on the planet. If you still are hesitant to believe that global warming is dangerous to the people in the United States, let me remind you that the USA is not the only country in the world. We have industry abroad- if countries we are trade partners with suffer, it will affect us too. If we get food from other countries struggling with the same shortages we have, that hurts us. Global warming will hurt every country and every individual, regardless of where you live. 
  </p>
  <p class="info">A source of doubt comes from the fossil fuels industry- people who have grown rich off of mining don’t necessarily want to give up their fortunes, and I don’t blame them- who would throw away a million dollar business? The issue arises, however, in that these people deny climate change, and use their money to influence politics. Thus, we stay stuck in an endless cycle, of people with lots of money who don’t want things to change, and the science community, who is in almost unanimous agreement that climate change is threatening us. We are in deadlock, eternally stuck in a state of stillness, and time is running out. Climate change will only get worse as we burn more oil and more coal and more gas. What these millionaires forget is that climate change will encompass every generation onward. They might be rich now, but their children and their children’s children will be impacted by the consequences of their actions. Money is good, and the economy is important… and climate change will hurt the economy. Nobody’s safe, but if we all come together we do have time to act. Denial doesn’t help the problem- it makes it worse. 
  </p>
  <p class="info"> Hopefully, this will serve as a warning, but also give a sliver of hope. Yes, global warming is happening, yes, it’s an American problem, and yes, humans are causing it. But, the benefit of being the cause of climate change is that we can stop ourselves. I pointed out that burning fossil fuels creates most of the greenhouse gases we emit- we can stop burning them. Improvements in farm processes could cut back on methane- a single American person wastes an average of a pound of food a day, so we clearly don’t need as much food as we’re making. Landfills where things rot and exude methane could be nonexistent, if we made more things recyclable.<sup>2</sup> The problem is taking that first step. It will take radical social policy, and massive amounts of effort, but it’s for the future of our Earth- which may be closer than we realize. Venice, Italy, as a result of rising water levels, is seeing horrible flooding- in some areas, its once sunny sidewalks are knee-deep in water. We need to act today, because it could be too late tomorrow.

      <B>1: </B>Climate change can be kind of a boring issue, especially when you're going over evidence and commentating, so I try to use some humor to spice it up a little.</p>
    <p>
      <b>2: </b>Because I'm writing an essay that'll hopefully persuade someone, I call them to action, telling them possible solutions for our climate change problem.
