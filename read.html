  Reading
  </h1>
  <p class="info">
  Admittedly, I love writing but tend to fall short when it comes to reading. I'm hooked on fantasy stories- pass me a copy of some magical tale and I'll tear through it- but I abandon, like every other genre.

  However, this year I fell in love with one of the most amazing books I've ever read- and it was a piece of realistic fiction! And a love story! These two genres I really disliked, but when I read this book I loved it.

  <i>Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe</i> is a remarkable book. Seriously, you have to read it. It's funny, it's heart-wrenching, and also finally depicts a grumpy teenager without being stereotypical- yay. It's about identity, and also about ~love.~ <b>Seriously please read this book, it's amazing.</b>

  Speaking of reading, I also took my first steps into literary analysis. <i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</i> is an old American fairytale we're all familiar with. But, I took it a level up, when I searched for themes of political corruption and populism. If you'd like to read it, the essay where I discuss those dark topics is on my writing page.
