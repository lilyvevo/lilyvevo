Everyday Courage
  </h1>
  <p class="info">
    The idea of ‘courage’ is popular, whether in fiction or in real life. Being brave is very much encouraged. Unfortunately, in something so pivotal, there’s no step-by-step plan to get it- and here, I’ll say- it’s okay to not know what bravery is and how to have it. Courage is everywhere- it isn’t merely confidence. I believe courage comes in everyday forms you might never even notice.<sup>1</sup>

    <p class="info">
	My experience with bravery isn’t slaying dragons or saving lives. In my life, the 	hypothetical dragon is type one diabetes. I’ve had it since I was three. It didn’t disrupt my childhood, just added some new rules to it. On top of doing all the things kids do, like running around naked, and drawing on the walls, I was taking insulin shots. It wasn’t a big deal to me then- I didn’t understand it; my parents were the ones shouldering the work. As I grew older, I also grew into my responsibility. Technology advanced, so some of the woes of diabetes care were reduced. But, once I became more competent of my illness I also became more competent of my mind. I understood diabetes required me to do a little extra to stay in good health, but it has never, ever held me back from being who I want to be.

  <p class="info">
	My best friend told me just before writing this- “I could never be diabetic, I’m terrified of needles.” I laughed; it was good natured. But honestly, sometimes I’m surprised I do what I do. Things don’t go wrong often, but when they do, my ‘everyday courage’ is small. I once had a low blood sugar in the middle of the night, and I was lucky I was awake; when I called my mom over to my room for help I felt almost too weak to talk. That was one of the scariest moments of my life, but it just happened all in one blurry hour. My mom holding my hand, growing somehow more worried when I looked into her eyes. I couldn’t feel my legs, and my limbs felt hollow like a cardboard box. I felt like a ghost in somebody else’s body. Me and my mom stayed next to one another till my glucose rose and I went back to sleep. But that experience didn’t just come and go, part of it stayed in my head. For a while after, before I slept each night, a thought lurked just below the surface.</p>
  <p class="info"><i>What if I don’t wake up tomorrow morning?</i></p>
<p class="info">But, I kept living. I didn’t have any other option. And soon, I really started to think.</p>
<p class="info">
I’ve always been told I was brave for dealing with a disease I had no choice but to deal with, and I always pushed the thought away, because I wasn’t brave, just.. Being me, doing what I had to.</p>
	<p class="info">I am brave. Anybody can be, because bravery fits the shape of its container. We all have everyday courage.<sup>2</sup>
