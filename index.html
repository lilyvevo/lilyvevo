    8th Grade English- Writing Portfolio
  </h1>
<p class="info">
  Welcome to my writing portfolio! Here, you'll find a small collection of pieces I wrote that are available to read, and a couple other tidbits of info. Enjoy! <br>These are all things I wrote throughout the school year, with one of them being from an extracurricular class. Thank you to my English teachers for helping me make my writing amazing- I'm really proud of what I've done and I hope other people like it too!<br>
